Creating a CUDA wrapper library that translates CUDA API calls to ROCm HIP for Windows is an ambitious project that involves several steps and considerations. The main goal here is to intercept CUDA function calls made by applications and redirect them to your wrapper, which then translates these calls to their ROCm HIP equivalents. This process involves creating a drop-in replacement for the CUDA runtime library. Here's an overview of how you might approach this:

### 1. **Understand CUDA and ROCm HIP Equivalents**

- **API Mapping**: Familiarize yourself with both CUDA and ROCm HIP APIs. Fortunately, HIP was designed to be as close as possible to CUDA, making the translation more straightforward for many functions. AMD provides a tool called `hipify` that can automate the translation of CUDA code to HIP code, which might be helpful for understanding the mappings between the two.

### 2. **Develop the Wrapper Library**

- **Function Interception**: Implement each CUDA function that you want to support in your library. These functions should have the same signatures as their CUDA counterparts. Within these functions, you will translate the CUDA calls to HIP calls. For example, if you have a CUDA application calling `cudaMalloc`, your wrapper would provide a `cudaMalloc` function that internally calls `hipMalloc`.

- **Dynamic Loading**: Your wrapper will need to dynamically load the ROCm HIP library at runtime. You can use Windows API functions like `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` to load the HIP DLL and retrieve function pointers to the HIP functions you need to call.

### 3. **Configure Applications to Use Your Wrapper**

- **Renaming the Original CUDA DLL**: One approach is to rename the original CUDA DLLs (e.g., `cudart64_xx.dll` for the CUDA runtime library) and replace them with your wrapper library DLL, which should be named exactly as the original CUDA DLL. This way, applications that link dynamically to the CUDA runtime will load your wrapper instead.

- **Manipulating the Library Search Path**: Ensure that the directory containing your wrapper library is earlier in the search path than the directory containing the original CUDA libraries. This can be done by modifying the `PATH` environment variable or using the `SetDllDirectory` function in your application.

- **Static Linking Considerations**: If an application is statically linked against CUDA, replacing the library becomes more complex and may not be feasible without recompiling the application against your wrapper library.

### 4. **Testing and Compatibility**

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Thoroughly test your wrapper with a variety of CUDA applications to ensure compatibility and to identify any missing or incorrectly implemented functions. Pay special attention to performance implications and any potential deviations in behavior between CUDA and ROCm HIP.

- **Versioning**: Be mindful of the CUDA and ROCm HIP versions you target. API compatibility may vary between versions, so it might be beneficial to focus on specific versions initially.

### 5. **Documentation and Open Sourcing**

- **Documentation**: Document your library thoroughly, including the mapping of CUDA functions to HIP functions, any limitations, and configuration instructions for using the wrapper.

- **Open Source**: Consider open-sourcing your wrapper library. The community can help improve, test, and extend the compatibility of your library, benefiting a wider range of applications and use cases.

### Legal Considerations

Be aware of legal and licensing issues. Ensure that your use of CUDA, ROCm HIP, and any other software complies with their respective licenses. It's also wise to consult with legal advice to navigate any potential intellectual property concerns, especially when developing a library that interfaces with proprietary technologies.

This project requires deep knowledge of both CUDA and ROCm HIP, as well as expertise in Windows DLLs and application binary interfaces (ABIs). While challenging, such a wrapper could significantly benefit applications looking to transition from CUDA to a more open platform like ROCm HIP on Windows.
