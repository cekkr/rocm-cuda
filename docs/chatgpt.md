# Introduction

Creating a wrapper library to allow CUDA applications to run on AMD hardware using ROCm's HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) involves several steps. HIP is designed to ease the portability of code across CUDA and ROCm, offering a way to write code that can run on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with minimal changes. However, automatically translating CUDA calls to HIP for existing applications that are not aware of HIP requires a bit more work. Here's an outline of the steps you'd need to follow:

### 1. Understand the Compatibility

- **CUDA to HIP Translation**: AMD provides a tool called `hipify` which automatically converts CUDA code to HIP code. However, this tool is intended for source code, not for binary applications. For a binary application, the process is not straightforward and would require intercepting CUDA API calls at runtime and translating them to their HIP equivalents.
- **API Mapping**: Most CUDA runtime API functions have direct HIP equivalents, but there are differences in behavior and supported features. You'll need to map CUDA functions to their HIP counterparts and handle any cases where the behavior is not directly translatable.

### 2. Create the Wrapper Library

- **Dynamic Library Interception**: Create a dynamic shared library (`.so` file on Linux) that intercepts CUDA API calls. This library should export the same symbols as the CUDA runtime library (`libcudart.so` for the runtime API).
- **Function Translation**: For each CUDA function you want to intercept, implement a corresponding function that translates the call to its HIP equivalent. This involves manually writing the translation logic, considering arguments, return values, and any necessary state management.
- **State Management**: Some CUDA functions may rely on global or static state within the CUDA runtime. You may need to replicate or manage this state within your wrapper to ensure consistent behavior.

### 3. Use LD_PRELOAD to Intercept Calls

- **Dynamic Linker Hook**: Use the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to load your wrapper library before any other library, including the CUDA runtime. This makes the dynamic linker resolve symbols in your library first, effectively intercepting and redirecting CUDA calls to your implementations.
- ```bash
  LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/your/libcuda_wrapper.so ./your_cuda_application
  ```

### 4. Testing and Debugging

- **Unit Testing**: Create unit tests for each function or feature you're wrapping to ensure your translations work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the wrapper with real-world CUDA applications to identify any issues with compatibility, performance, or correctness.
- **Debugging Tools**: Use debugging and profiling tools to identify and fix issues. Tools like `gdb` for debugging and AMD's ROCm profiling tools can help understand performance characteristics and ensure correctness.

### Additional Notes

- **Performance**: While HIP is designed to be efficient, the overhead of intercepting and translating calls, plus any differences in performance characteristics between CUDA and HIP, might affect the performance of your application.
- **Compatibility**: Not all CUDA features may have direct equivalents in HIP, especially newer or more obscure features. You'll need to handle these cases, possibly by implementing workarounds or limiting support.

This approach requires a good understanding of both CUDA and HIP APIs, as well as experience with Linux dynamic libraries and runtime linking mechanisms. It's a non-trivial task but can be a rewarding way to enable CUDA applications to run on AMD hardware.

# C++ Example

Creating a wrapper library in C++ to intercept and translate CUDA API calls to HIP, specifically for the function that retrieves the number of CUDA devices, involves several steps. Below is a simple example illustrating how you might intercept the `cudaGetDeviceCount` function, translate it to its HIP equivalent, and compile it into a shared library. This example assumes you have basic knowledge of C++ and Linux development tools.

### Step 1: Wrapper Function Implementation

First, you'll need to write the function that intercepts `cudaGetDeviceCount` and calls the HIP equivalent, `hipGetDeviceCount`.

Create a file named `cuda_to_hip_wrapper.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

// CUDA's cudaGetDeviceCount equivalent
extern "C"
cudaError_t cudaGetDeviceCount(int *count) {
    std::cout << "Intercepted cudaGetDeviceCount call" << std::endl;
    // Translate the call to its HIP counterpart
    hipError_t hipError = hipGetDeviceCount(count);
    // For simplicity, we're directly mapping HIP error codes to CUDA's.
    // In a full implementation, you'd want to translate HIP errors to their CUDA equivalents.
    return static_cast<cudaError_t>(hipError);
}
```

This code snippet defines a function with the same signature as `cudaGetDeviceCount`, making it possible to intercept calls to the CUDA function. Inside, it simply prints a message for demonstration purposes and forwards the call to `hipGetDeviceCount`, converting the HIP error code to a CUDA error code. This is a simplification; a real implementation would need to handle error code translation more carefully.

### Step 2: Compiling the Wrapper into a Shared Library

To compile this wrapper into a shared library, you can use `g++` with the `-shared` and `-fPIC` options. You'll also need to include the HIP headers and link against the HIP runtime. The exact command depends on your system configuration, but it might look something like this:

```bash
g++ -fPIC -shared cuda_to_hip_wrapper.cpp -o libcudart_wrapper.so -I/opt/rocm/hip/include -L/opt/rocm/lib -lhip_hcc
```

This command creates `libcudart_wrapper.so`, a shared library that can be preloaded to intercept CUDA runtime calls.

### Step 3: Using the Wrapper Library with LD_PRELOAD

To use this wrapper library with a CUDA application, you can set the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to the path of your shared library before running the application. This instructs the dynamic linker to load your library first, intercepting any calls to `cudaGetDeviceCount`.

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcudart_wrapper.so ./your_cuda_application
```

### Caveats and Considerations

- This simple example demonstrates intercepting a single CUDA function. A comprehensive wrapper would need to handle many more functions.
- Error handling and conversion between CUDA and HIP error codes are simplified here. A robust implementation should carefully map between the two to ensure correct application behavior.
- Performance overhead and compatibility issues should be considered and tested extensively.

This example provides a basic starting point. Expanding it into a full wrapper library would involve implementing similar wrappers for other CUDA functions, handling edge cases, and thoroughly testing with target applications.
